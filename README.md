# UgaEats-Final
Created by Bradley Reeves, Lakshay Sharma, James O'Boyle, and Brandon Lee. This is a project that I did with a group for Web Programming. It will not work correctly without the database that we created and it has to run off of a server like WildFly. Because this was an in-class project we did not get a server to actually deploy our project on. If you want to run it then get a WildFly, Eclipse Neon, and MySQL Community Server.  Then create the tables/database in the MySQL server, then update the DB_CONNECTION_USERNAME and DB_CONNECTION_PASSWORD objects in DbAccessConfiguration.java.  Finally, run the program in Eclipse Neon.
