# UgaEats-Final
Created by Bradley Reeves, Lakshay Sharma, James O'Boyle, and Brandon Lee. This is a project that I did with a group for Web Programming. It will not work correctly without the database that we created and it has to run off of a server like WildFly. Because this was an in-class project we did not get a server to actually deploy our project on. Check out some of the html pages and read through the code for more information.
